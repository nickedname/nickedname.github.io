Introduction
</h2>
<p>
This Post-Mortem is about a game created by me for the Course Game Mechanics. <br>
It will consist of the experiences I made during the design and creation process of said game. <br>
The game itself is a puzzle platformer where the player plays as an angry hero that is on fire. <br>
While dodging and burning enemies in his wake, he seeks to find the evil mother-in-law who kidnapped his princess. <br>

What went right?

I loved (albeit a bit too much) creating the lock and key mechanisms in the game as balancing them was more challenging than the rest of the game.<br>
The idea to keep the look of the game as simple as possible really helped me adjust the game.<br>
I happened to coincidentally make the lock and key mechanisms in a manner that allowed the enemies to be introduced in the same manner as was shown in megaman<br>
The enemies just happened to be shown before the player interacts with them. I ended up enjoying creating the puzzle more as a result of the possibilities.<br>

<h2>
What went wrong?
</h2>
<p>
First of all, the most important one is not finishing before the deadline. Both bad planning and adding features were mostly at fault here.<br>
  -	I either badly designed the boss fight or totally planned it badly, since I did not go in-depth to what the boss fight required me to do.<br>
	While designing I just wanted the boss to use different enemies every state, but that required a different ‘setting’ every state for the player to learn from, which in turn required a transition between environment for credibility.<br>
  	I would probably end up spending the most time on the bossfight if I hadn't already spent my time wrong on other things.<br>
  -	Although the usage of simple basic shapes kept my time creating levels low, I also ended up spending too much time making the plot look credible.<br>
  -	I’ve spent too much time thinking about implementing water, due to my misunderstanding of needing a rock paper scissor element in my game.<br>
	Had I read the rubric before designing then I probably wouldn't have implemented any water.<br>
  -	In the second review, they commented that for the player the goal was too unclear. I then spent too much time resolving the feedback immediately. <br>
	This could’ve been done better at the end phase of creating the game since resolving feedback was no part of the rubric.<br>
  -	Adding cutscenes was a last-ditch effort to make the setting clear for the player which was the downside of using basic shapes.<br>

<h2>
What have I learned
</h2>
<p>
I’m still not a big fan of Unity, but that might be slightly prejudiced due to my experiences with older versions of Unity as the current version is definitely way better.<br>
I  should definitely read through the rubric more carefully when making an assignment as it would definitely have saved me some time.<br>
I shouldn’t stray too far from the original planning I made at the start or plan accordingly.<br>
Also I need to get some priorities in planning straight as I shouldn’t commit to making a game look pretty before actually finishing the game itself.<br>
