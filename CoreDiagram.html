<h2>Core Diagram</h2>

<p>Inside the core diagram you show what your game's core mechanic, secondary mechanics, method of progression and narrative are.<br>
The assignment for school was to create a core mechanic revolving around a physics element.<br>
I reasoned that temperature is a very important part of physics not often used in games(unless you count explosions).<br>
With that in mind I've made the following Core Diagram. </p>

<p>My core mechanic in my game revolves around the trail of fire left behind the player. <br>
The player can use this trail to ignite entities, making them a temporary source of fire trails like himself. <br>
This can spread like wildfire if properly timed and aimed, making a good player capable of killing multiple enemies in a single move <br>
However the fire also eats at the entity's health, destroying it after a certain duration, making it the player's duty tactfully ignite the objects in the right order </p>

<p>My secondary mechanics in the game revolves around melting ice with fire, heating air (in balloons) and igniting fuses of cannons (because we love explosions)</p>

<p>The main progression in the game is done by collecting (stealing) hearts from rectangles (pure maidens) by reaching them.<br>
<p>Hearts are required to unlock doorways to new areas in the game using the power of your fanbase </p>

<p>The game's narrative is about saving your honeymoon from the evil corporation of mother-in-laws whose sole purpose is to prevent you from collecting hearts.</p>
