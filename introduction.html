Game Mechanics
</H2>
<p>
For my course Game Mechanics I've made this portfolio site and a prototype of a game.</br>
The game will be playtested throughout the development process.</br>
The game plot revolves around a hero whose princess gets stolen by great evil(mother in law).</br>

The game mechanics revolve around solving puzzles while sustaining the flame on your character.</br>
Enemies are introduced from easy to hard difficulty.</br>
Upon reaching the final boss you can use your knowledge against it.</br>
Unfortunately I had to remove parts of the code, because Unity had issues upon building.</br>
The boss fight also didn't make it and it's concept shall be remembered.</br>
