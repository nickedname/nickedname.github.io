<h2> Concept Pitch  & feedback </h2>

<p> 
As an assignment in Game Mechanics I've held a concept pitch about my game concept. <br>
In response, I got the following construcive criticism on my concept:<br>
It's mainly based on programming and not on game design.<br>
Winning/losing conditions are still unclear.<br>
Temperature is not sufficient as a physics on it's own and I should add more physics
</p>
<p>
I've considered the critiques and how I will implement them in my game:<br>
I consider myself capable of handling the programming as I took my previous experience of programming into account when designing the game. <br>
If time allows I will consider a better Winning/Losing condition than respawning on death.<br>
During class I had an idea to allow the player to play a mini-game when taking fatal damage, allowing him to respawn further away from the respawn point(like collecting blue flames along the way to respawn).<br>	
As for temperature, I really want it to be the sole theme of the game, however I decided to try and implement a contagious effect for igniting enemies.<br>
I still think this part can be expanded on, however I concluded that I shouldn't add too much work in the design phase<br>
