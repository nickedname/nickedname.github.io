<h2> Concept Pitch  & feedback </h2>

<h3>
	Part 1. Feedback on Game Concept
</h3>

<p> 
As an assignment in Game Mechanics I've held a concept pitch about my game concept. <br>
In response, I got the following construcive criticism on my concept:<br>
 * It's mainly based on programming and not on game design.<br>
 * Winning/losing conditions are still unclear.<br>
 * Temperature is not sufficient as a physics on it's own and I should add more physics
</p>
<p>
I've considered the critiques and how I will implement them in my game:<br>
 * 	I consider myself capable of handling the programming as I took my previous experience of programming into account when designing the game. <br>
 * 	If time allows I will consider a better Winning/Losing condition than respawning on death.<br>
 * 	During class I had an idea to allow the player to play a mini-game when taking fatal damage, allowing him to respawn further away from the respawn point(like collecting blue flames along the way to respawn).<br>	
	As for temperature, I really want it to be the sole theme of the game, however I decided to try and implement a contagious effect for igniting enemies.<br>
	I still think this part can be expanded on, however I concluded that I shouldn't add too much work in the design phase<br>
</p>

<h3>
	Part 2. Feedback after first playtest
</h3>
<p>
In the playtest arranged by Game Mechanics, I have tested and playtested other games. <br>
The following critique was given: <br>
 *	The movement of the player was clunky<br>
 * 	The objective was unclear<br>
 *	The water made the enemy hard to see<br>
 *	Not enough playtime/content<br>
</p>
<p>
I have noted the following behaviour of the playtester:<br>
 *	The playtester wasn't scared of the water<br>
 *	The playtester went to the right immediately<br>
</p>
<p>
In regards to the things I've learned in the playtest I will adapt the following:<br>
 *	I will make the water more transparent<br>
 *	I will remove the acceleration on the player movement<br>
 *	The objective of the player needs to be clear at the beginning of the game<br>
 *	The water in the game will have to become scarier(?)<br>
 *	The game will probably be going towards the right and secret locations will be hidden to the left<br>
</p>
 
<h3>
	Part 3. Feedback after second playtest
</h3>
<p>
The following critique was given: <br>
 *	The player jump was clunky<br>
 * 	The objective was unclear until around the second objective<br>
 *	The player was confused by how the cannons are activated<br>
 *	The player said the game had a boring feeling due to lack of sound<br>
</p>
<p>
I have noted the following behaviour of the playtester:<br>
 *	The playtester was annoyed by the jumping<br>
 *	The playtester was initially confused by lack of guidance<br>
 *	The playtester ignored water alltogether (but at least he could see through it)<br>
</p>
<p>
In regards to the things I've learned in the playtest I will adapt the following:<br>
 *  due to time constraints( started feedback way too late) I had no time to implement them into my game
